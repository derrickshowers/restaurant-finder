# Restaurant Finder

Backbone app which will eventually include a node backend to enable db connection. Still very much a work in progress, but when finished, will be a place to keep a list of all of my favorite restaurants in town. Sure, Yelp is great, but doesn't really offer a way to easily store/retrieve weekly events and schedules. This won't have reviews, but just some general information about the restaurant and weekly specials/events like Triva, Happy Hour, etc.

Here are a few more ways to check it out:
* [Demo](http://backbone.dev.derrickshowers.com/)
* [Progress Journal](https://github.com/derrickshowers/restaurant-finder/wiki/Journal)
* Or, just check out the code!
